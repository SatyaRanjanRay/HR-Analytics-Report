Dashboard on Employee Attendance Insights🧑🏻‍💻📈📉

In this Project I have done visualisation on Employee Dataset for HR team which involves Attendance insights, WFH percentage and Sick-Leave percentage.
I have developed a dashboard incorporating key performance indicators with interactive visualizations and filtering options.
Using the power query I seamlessly transformed and shaped the data to create calculated columns and measures utilizing DAX which then I visualized using Area charts and cards and also gained insights of various trends over a time period, enabaling the company to make informed decisions and optimized strategies. 
This dashboard says a lot about the working preferances of Employees whether they tend to work from office or home.
It also shows the day of week when employees prefer to work at office or from home.

#### These Insights will help in making various decisions such as: 
Team meeting and gatherings can be held when most of the employees stays present at the office 
Better sanitizations and precautions can be done by taking the Sick leave percentage into consideration
It can also help in improving work balance , maintaining a healthy environment and proper utilizations of resources.

Step1: Understanding the HR requirement

Step3: Creating Calculated columns and Measures using DAX
Step4: Data visualizations and tracking KPIs various charts and cards
